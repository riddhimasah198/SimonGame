# Simon Game
This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, where players must remember and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game tests memory skills and provides an engaging, interactive experience.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Users can interact with four colored buttons (red, yellow, green, and blue).
Dynamic Levels: Each level adds a new step to the sequence, challenging the player’s memory.
Responsive Design: The game adjusts the UI dynamically to provide visual feedback for user actions and game-generated sequences.
Score Display: The user’s current level is displayed, and a final score is shown on game over.
Reset and Retry: Users can restart the game by pressing any key after a game over.
How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key to begin.
Watch the Sequence: The game will flash a button to start a sequence. Each level adds one new button to the sequence.
Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
Progress: If the sequence is correct, you advance to the next level. If not, the game ends, and your score (level) is displayed.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the game layout.
CSS: For styling the game elements.
JavaScript: For implementing game logic and interactivity.
